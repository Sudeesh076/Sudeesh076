## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis on Haberman Dataset
### The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.- kaggle.com

* EDA is done on this dataset to get some insights of features and their dependencies and importance for solving our problem
* Analysing some useful statistics from data
#### Structure of Repo-
##### There is one folder named Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Haberman-Dataset which contains .ipynb notebook and its pdf form
##### links : 
* Repository : https://github.com/Sudeesh076/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Haberman-Dataset

## 2. Performing Analysis of Meteorological-Data
### This is about Analysis on Meteorological Data from Finland, a country in the Northern Europe. One type of data that’s easier to find on the Internet is Weather Data. The Given Dataset is taken from Kaggle, the dataset has hourly Temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006–04–01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016–09–09 23:00:00.000 +0200
* Perform Data Cleaning, Perform Analysis for Testing the (given) Hypothesis and finally put forth your conclusion by writing a blog article.
